To run the code
===============
python train_moglow.py 'hparams/locomotion.json' locomotion


To adapt to new data
====================
Modify the hyperparameters defined in 'hparams/locomotion.json'. Note that the following entries must match the input and control dimensions:

"n_features": number of output features (joint coordinates in our case)
"cond_channels": size of the conditioning information. This is calculated as sequence_length * n_features + (sequence_length + 1 + n_lookahead) * n_control_features

In the MoGlow paper:

sequence_length = 10
n_lookahead = 0
n_control_features = 3 (dx, dz, dr)
n_features = 63 (joint coordinates)

=> cond_channels = 63*10 + 11 * 3 = 663

Start tuning the network with dropout set to 0.5 and number of flows K set to 4 or 8.
